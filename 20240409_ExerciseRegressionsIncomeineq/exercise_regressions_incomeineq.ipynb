For example, these analyses will not account for things like gender discrimination in terms of *getting* jobs. We'll discuss this in more detail below."

The file is called `morg18.dta` and is a Stata dataset.

In this context, for example, we can add fixed effects for the industry of each respondent—since wages often vary across industries, controlling for industry is likely to improve our estimates. Use `ind02` to control for industry.\n",

Whereas in previous exercises we were trying to explain variation in men and women's wages *across all respondents*, we are now effectively comparing men and women's wages *within each employment sector*. Our coefficient on `female`, in other words, now tells us how much less (on average) we would expect a woman to be paid than a man *within the same industry*, not across all respondents. \n",
    "\n",
